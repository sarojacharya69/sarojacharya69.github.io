  	Sagarmatha National Park lies in the north-eastern part of Nepal. The prime feature of the park is that it covers a wide area with altitudes ranging from nearly 3000m to as high as 8000m. Thus, this beautiful park has varying forms of flora such as dense forests in the lower regions, mosses and lichens in the high altitudes and with zero vegetation in the highest areas.
