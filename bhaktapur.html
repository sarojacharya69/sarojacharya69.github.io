    	The Durbar Square is a public area containing centuries-old royal palaces and adjoining temples, gardens and other monuments from the times when Nepal was three separate kingdoms. The entire area consists of four main squares where you can spot temples dedicated to various Hindu deities like Bhairava, Pashupatinath, Krishna and Shiv-Parvati, gates like Lion Gate and Golden Gate, the 55 Window Palace, statue of King Bhupatindra Malla, and many such beautiful structures.
